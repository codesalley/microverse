                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son
                    and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                    beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>

                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A
                    potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
                    of
                    light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>

                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                    pole
                    and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                    irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
                    in
                    the ocean.
                </p>

                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around

                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the
                    South

                    Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                    detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a
                    universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                    trillionth
                    of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and
                    his
                    colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                </p>

                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                    wondered
                    whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>
                <p class="post-pragraph">

                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery
                    of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of
                    time
                    and space and energy to science and speculation.
                </p>


                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                    with
                    its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                    extent,
                    architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
                    number
                    of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                </p>

                <span class="sub-heading"> ‘As Big as It Gets’</span>

                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond
                    the
                    reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
                    ripples
                    would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory
                    of
                    general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                </p>

                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                    team,
                    said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                </p>
                <p class="post-pragraph">

                    He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                    gravitational waves.”
                </p>

                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                    permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as
                    the
                    surface of the sun.
                </p>

                <p class="post-pragraph">
                    Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                    Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                    Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                    Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
                    confirmation

                    The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.

                    few,

                    By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                    spread,
                    astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
                    Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at <span id="mit">M.I.T</span> ., wrote in an email,

                    John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
                    called
                    the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful

                    convincing,” he said.

                    universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model,
                    but he
                    expressed reservations about inflation.

                    Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting
                    that
                    the

                    Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
                    discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the

                    Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the
                light
                waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
                waves,
                squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction
                of
                polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should
                have
                little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
                microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

                “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard
                supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
                breakthrough.

            <span class="sub-heading">A Special Time</span> <br>
            <p class="post-pragraph">

                The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his
                Palo
                Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and
                weak
                nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single
                unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
                mythology
                of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after
                another
                splitting away.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                That was where Dr. Guth came in.
            </p>
            <p class="post-pragraph">

                Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
                until
                it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space
                itself
                would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
                universe
                would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was
                created,
                the harder it pushed apart.
            </p>
            <p class="post-pragraph">

                What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
                submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.

                Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of
                normal
                cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
                billions

                of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to
                say,
                “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
                suggest
                that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey
                expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a
                concept
                known as the multiverse.
            </p>

            <p class="post-pragraph">
                So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
                deeper
                into the past.
            </p>
            <p class="post-pragraph">

                We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
                everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
                forever out of our view.
            </p>

            “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part
            of
            the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
